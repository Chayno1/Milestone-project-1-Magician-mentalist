# Milestone 1 - Magician/Mentalist

 



## WHO IS THIS FOR AND WHY THEY NEED A WEBSITE.

I perform as a magician and mentalist, performing magic tricks and mind reading effects at parties,weddings, birthdays and other organised events. My act is unique as it combines traditional magic tricks  with traditinal mentalism effects reinvented for a mordern day audience. My act comes in three types of performance, close up/walkaround, parlour and stage. I take bookings for my performances and most of my bookings are aquired by word of mouth. Across the country there are lots of magicians available to book however no two magicians are the same, each magician has his or her own unique style and method of performing. In this case it is important for anyone booking a magic act to understand what type of magician they want to book and what type of act. For the magician it is important to showcase his or her own unique style and type of act they are able to perform. To help showcase this for me, I have decided to build a website to help potenial bookers get a feel and understsanding of myself as a performer and what kind of performances I do. It can also provide a way of communicating any queries regarding my services or enquirie to potenial bookings.




## PROJECT AIM

The aim of the project is to build a website that describes the performer and the services that they provide and a way of contacting the performer with questions or enquires.




## WEBSITE NEEDS (business needs)

- Examples of different situations/events in which the performer and their acts are best suited

- A way for anyone visiting to make enquries

## WEBSITE DESIGN NEEDS

## ACTION PLAN

To achieve the aim of the project I'm going to design a website consisting of 4 pages, a home page, an about page, a gallery page and a contact page.

### The Home Page

- The Home page will be the main opening page of the site, it will contain content with the overview of website, basic information describing what the web page is for and where to find relavent information.

### The About Page 

- The about page will have content about the performer him self and a description of the acts he performs and examples of when and where those acts are best suited.

### The Gallery Page

- The gallery page will be a collection of photos showcasing the performer in action performing at different events.

### The Contact Page 

- The contact page will be where visitors to the site can fill out an enquiry form to pose a question or enquire about a potenial booking.

To help visitors move between the pages I'm going to input a navbar. This will sit in the header of main body of the page. 
To keep the website simple and easy to use I'm going to have the same header and footer on every page of the site. This will help visitors intuitively understand how to move around the website.
The header will consist of the name of the performer and performance type and navbar.
The Footer will consist of email contact details for the performer and performers local location and distance willing to travel.
As an addition to the website I will also add links to social media for the performer, this will be placed in the footer opening in a separate tab giving the user oppertunity to find further information on the performer and also allowing them to remain on the website.

## Website Design choices

### Website Navigation

- To help visitors move between the pages I'm going to input a navbar. This will sit in the header of main body of the page. 
To keep the website simple and easy to use I'm going to have the same header on every page of the site. This will help visitors intuitively understand how to move around the website.

- The header will consist of the name of the performer and performance type and navbar.

### Website Footer

- The Footer will consist of email contact details for the performer and performers local location and distance willing to travel.

- Like the Header and navbar the footer will be the same across all four pages of the site, giving the user opportunity to quickly access additional social media links or contact perofrmer from any page on the site.

### Website Main body

- This is the area in between the header/navbar and footer where the main content as described in the action plan will sit on each page.

### colours 

- I have choosen colours for the website based off a few promotional photos for the performer, I will be using these photos as the main images on the site and will base the colours on the photos.

<span style="color:#2125" >color used shadows</span>
<span style="color:#343a40">color used for header</span>
<span style="color:rgb(40, 126, 175)">color used for titles</span>
<span style="color:aliceblue">color used for text</span>
