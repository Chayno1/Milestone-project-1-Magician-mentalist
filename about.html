               <h3>About Chay</h3> 
               <br>
               <p>Chay is an experienced performer, entertaining audiences all over the UK and 
                 internationally for over 10 years, starting with his fascination with magic 
                 as child, Chay quickly built a reputation as a skilled performer in the art 
                 of magic, specialising in magic with cards, coins and everyday objects.
                 As his career progressed, he developed a unique ability to apply his skill 
                 to mentalism. Using a variety of techniques, psychology, hypnosis-suggestion,
                 magic, instinct and showmanship, Chay has built a mind reading act that will 
                 amaze, and entertain all. Blending these two fields together makes a unique, 
                 fun experience everyone can enjoy!</p>
